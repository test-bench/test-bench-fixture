# Test Bench Fixture

A TestBench [Fixture](http://test-bench.software/user-guide/fixtures.html) is a pre-defined, reusable test abstraction. By
including `TestBench::Fixture`, any class can use the TestBench DSL. Fixture classes are typically actuated as part of another
TestBench test, but they can also be exercised and tested in isolation.
